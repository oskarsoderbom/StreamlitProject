    Parameters:

    This function optimises the parameters alpha, beta, and gamma using the method of maximum likelihood estimation.
    The parameters are optimised iteratively until the change in the parameters is less than a specified threshold.

    estimate the parameters. The parameters are the attacking strength (alpha), defensive strength (beta), and home
    advantage (gamma) of each team.

    The function iterates over each team in the dataset, and for each team, it calculates the new values of alpha and
